Henna Care Sheet

Henna can last from 1-2 weeks depending on body placement, frequency and the vigour of your bathing routine, and skin type.

You should apply at least one coat of lemon-sugar solution. This helps the staining process and also keeps the dried paste on your skin.

The longer you keep your henna paste on your skin the darker the stain will be. We suggest you leave the dried paste on for at least 6 hours, or overnight, for best results.

When you first remove the henna paste the stain will be light orange, but will continue to darken over the next 2-3 days.

Scrubbing and constant exposure to water will remove your henna tattoo more quickly.
